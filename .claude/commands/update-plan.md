Help me update the PROJECT_PLAN.md file:

1. Ask what was completed
2. Update the relevant checkboxes in the plan
3. Update the status sections
4. Update the "Last Updated" date
5. Show a summary of progress

Make sure to:
- Mark completed items with [x]
- Update phase status if phase is complete
- Move to next priority if current task is done
- Celebrate progress! 🎉
